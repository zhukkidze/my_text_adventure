Here are the project that codecademy provides. I need to build a program that have user choices, multiple outcomes. The code shall have LOOPS, VARIABLES and full range of what we went through.

1) Hardest thing is to pick up a story to develop into the code.
  - choosing your future career while finishing school.

2) According to the Codecademy goal, I need to add  ASCII art to the title.

  - let it be some arrows showing left, straight and right directions.

3) Splitting each career in 3-4 ways to provide more choices.
	- Programming engineer has 3 ways to become:
		1) Start self-study while in school.
		2) Right after finishing High-School enter IT courses.
		3) Enter University for computer science study after High-School.
		4) All the above - to be a real self-made genius with good knowledge and practice.

4) 
		a)	 One of the best choices.
		It offers the opportunity to become a self-made specialist with countless ways to explore how everything worksâ€”not only in life but also in the field of IT.
		It's also the longest and the hardest way to be the one. It will show all benefits of that way when you meet like-minded people in the future.
		b) 	Good choice.
		With that choice you can concentrate on general studies in your high-school and make sure that you have good grades.
		And right after with good diploma in overall studies you enter university.
